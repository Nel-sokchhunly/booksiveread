**Thoughts:**

I finished reading this book on 21st Feb 2026. It took me about a month to finished this book partly because i dont have enough time to read, otherwise i would have finished it in a week.

I picked this book up after finishing [[Before The Coffee Gets Cold]] and i really like the vibe of the cafe in that book that I consulted with GPT for book that has this vibe and jazzy and it recommended this book, which i think is the perfect recommendation.

if i have to describe this book in one word, it would be "Captivating". 

this is the book that get my interest pique so hard, and the last time that i remember that any book that did this was back in high-school when i read khmer literature, [[កុលាបប៉ៃលិន]] .


**Book Reflection:**

I don't think that this book has any hidden meaning in particular to be discover? perhaps i am just a shallow guy who can't see past the book. Even though i think that, the book is very interesting to say the least. 

the way the author write the book, how he describes the place setting, how he leads me(the reader) through out the book is very very interesting. Reading this book, somehow feels like i am actually there with the characters in the Denny's, listening to the jazz music background with them, but purely as a 4th wall observer that cannot interact with them. 

the progress of the one is just 2 stories, parallel to each other, progressing over night. this book capture this feeling of being the only person awake in the darkest part of the night while the whole world is deep in their sleeping realm.

the book is very poetic, the way that the author describe something is very vivid and interesting.

here is a snippet of how he's describing Denny's:

> 
> *We are inside a Denny's*
> 
> Unremarkable but adequate lighting; expressionless decor and dinnerware; floor plan designed to the last detail by management engineers; innocuous background music at low volume; staff meticulously trained to deal with customers by the book; "Welcome to Denny's." Everything about the restaurant is anonymous and interchangeable. And almost every seat is filled.
> 

the story of the book follows 2 sisters, Mari and Eri. the stories goes like this, while Eri is deep in her slumber sleep, her sister Mari is sitting alone reading her book in Denny's and encountered a series of events that lead her wandering around the city in the darkest part of the night.

I just got back into reading recently so i can't form any much thoughts.


**Book Setting Place:**

The book start ay Denny's, a restaurant that open 24/7, they play jazz background music. the whole book is set overnight from around midnight to 7am. it explores the darkest time of the night. it explores a theme of what it called **night people**, people who is out at night while they should be as sleep.

the books also have a few of Jazz record that i can add to my jazz playlist too which i like. All the records I encountered while reading the book is added to the book playlist above.


**Next Book?:**

I dont know what to read yet but I want to read Sputnik Sweetheart by Marukami next as I really like his style of writing in this book, but we'll see. maybe I will borrow a book from Litey and read that instead. There might be a chance that I will buy [[កុលាបប៉ៃលិន]] and read that instead too.

only time will tells.

this is the end of this "blog" and I will see you at my next book reflection.
