**Thoughts:**

This is the first book that I completed in 2026 and i think this is a good start to my reading journey of 2026.
one of my [[2026 Resolutions List]] is to read more so this is a good start.


**Book Reflection:**

I think this book has a very important lesson for those people including me to learn from is that, even though how much you regret your decision and want it to change, even to the point that you wish you could go back in time to change it, it won't solve anything. 

that's why in the book, they only allow you to travel through time once and you cannot change anything, but the people that went through time turned out to be the one that changed. 

they found a new perspective, and closure and i think that is very beautiful.

we should live more in the present and content with that we have going on in our life.

idk what i am writing tbh lol


**Book Setting Place:**

I am not sure if i will keep this section in the next book review, but this book has a very beautiful setting place. The book set in a small basement cafe with no sunlight and a sepia hue lamp light. they have 3 clocks which show diff times. there is no music background playing, so the only background noise are people talking and the sound of coffee being brewed. I really find this type of setting beautiful and intimate.


**Next Book:**

since I really like this book setting, i asked gpt to recommend me books that have similar setting, and it recommended me [[After Dark]] by Haruki Murakami. I will read this one next.
